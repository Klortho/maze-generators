# Maze generators

## Contents

* [Docs](./docs/main.md) - various papers and web pages related to maze generation
  algorithms.

* [Ladybug](./ladybug/maze.html) - a maze generator that uses fabricjs to
  draw a maze to the canvas, and enables the arrow keys to animate a ladybug
  through it.
* [Simple set-union](./simple-set-union/README.md) - a very simple
  (proof-of-concept) command-line JavaScript program that generates a maze
  using the set-union algorithm, and prints it on standard out.
* [Ladybug variations](./ladybug-variations/) - the ladybug maze generator
  with selectable renderers. Not done.

* [Big Maze Postscript printer](big-maze-postscript/main.md) - this isn't a
  maze-generator itself, but is an experiment with manipulating PostScript
  to print out a large maze on several sheets (tiled).


## To do

* Study the algorithm described in "The art of obfuscation"
* Investigate the branching factors for mazes produced by various algorithms
