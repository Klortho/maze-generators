# Maze generators

Contents:

* [Lady Bug](./ladybug/maze.html) - a maze generator that uses fabricjs to
  draw a maze to the canvas, and enables the arrow keys to animate a ladybug
  through it.
* [simple-set-union](./simple-set-union/README.md) - a very simple
  (proof-of-concept) command-line JavaScript program that generates a maze
  using the set-union algorithm, and prints it on standard out.
