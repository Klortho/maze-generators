    <h1>Testing fabric.js</h1>

    <p>This is an experiment to see if I can use both native canvas methods along
      with fabric.  Then, I could draw the maze walls (quickly) using native
      methods, and use fabric to animate the sprite and other stuff.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, it doesn't work.  When you draw with fabric, it wipes out
      anything you drew with native methods.</p>
    <p>You don't see anything red below, do you?</p>
